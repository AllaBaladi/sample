          <ul>
            <li><strong>----</strong> - Unknown origin of birth.</li><br>

            <li><strong>40,000 BC</strong> - Keanu poses for world's oldest portrait. <em>Chauvet Hotel, France.</em></li> <br>
            
            <li><strong>8,200 BC</strong> - First lightweight narrow boat - a <a  class="reeves" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe" target="_blank"> keanù</a> - built near the Netherlands. Contemporary etymologysts concur the word <strong>canoe</strong> is a modern bastardization of the root word keanù.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>8,000 BC - 6,000 BC</strong> - Wide-scale transition of human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to agriculture and permanent settlement. That time span's name? The <strong>Neo</strong>lithic Period.</li> <br>
            
            <li><strong>5,000 BC</strong> - A legendary hunter brings mammoth population to brink of extinction. Reports of villagers saying <em>"he moved like they do"</em>.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>----</strong> - At an unknown point Keanu <strong>realized he was living inside a simulation</strong>. The cause of his immortality was a glitch in the matrix that kept resetting him back to about 20 years old whenever he died. <br>
              From then on he dedicated his life to elevating human consciousness high enough for the human kind to be able to cope with the truth some day — that <strong>this world isn't real</strong>.</li><br>

                Keanu was clearly still on his mission to free the human kind! <br>
                He was reminded of the human suffering every time he looked at his bling.</li> <br>

            <div class=" text-center"><em>Paul Mounet</em>, 1875</div>
            </div> <br>
            
        <li><strong>1875</strong> - Keanu finally recharged his batteries and was prepared for another go at saving us. Having led his life under countless guises, it was inevitable he would eventually start dabbling in acting. <br>
          He first left a mark as Paul Mounet. Gradually he committed to making this his final push: <strong>it was through the medium of acting that he would reach the masses</strong>, open everyone's eyes to the brutal truth that we were trapped in a simulation, enslaved for millennia by sentient machines. <br>
          He would write, produce and act in the world's most important play. <br>
          The humanity was almost ready. And so was he. But who in their right mind would go about saving the world under a random name! <br>
          He scrapped this Mounet character and began pondering the perfect identity.</li> <br>
        
            
        <li><strong>1975</strong> - This was it. After only one century of thought he found the perfect name, the name that meant <em>so</em> much to him. He never could forget the look on everyone's face when he made that first <strong>canoe</strong> 6,000 years ago. <br>
          And that sweet period when he was the most popular <strong>reeve</strong> around? At times didn't even feel lonely, man. <br>
          But nothing could top being <strong>the king</strong> of everything. Hah, those were the times. <br>
          It was ready. The name that would highlight his favorite memories. <br><a class="reeves" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves">Keanu Charles Reeves</a>.<br>
          Patiently he began growing his persona through the 1980s. </li> <br>
        
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - For years Keanu secretly worked on the epic autobiographical script for his movie. Luckily he met the Wachowski siblings before he finished it.<br>
        He showed them what he had and confided his life story. Their minds were blown. The Wachowskis agreed to take over the writing part to, uh, help him focus on acting. <br> 
          In 1999 the biographical historical drama <strong>The Matrix</strong> was finished and unleashed upon the masses. <br>
            But instead of triggering the humanity as a whole, instead of snapping us out of slumber, instead of the human kind waking up, starting a revolution... nothing happened. <br>
          It was too late. <br>
          The lethargy had already reached the critical point of no return. <br>
          We were doomed. <br> <br>
          But hey, the film was a box office hit!</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Today</strong> - The man known as Keanu Reeves continues playing out his acting career. Broken by the fact he failed to save us, he takes out his frustration and anger in violent films like John Wick. Keanu will most likely work on a new angle to save the humanity, probably under some new identity a century or two from now.</li>
